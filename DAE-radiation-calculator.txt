Dear Aditya,

It is nice to know that you(and the team) are working on the problem "Personal radiation
dosage calculator" of Dept. of Atomic Energy.

Before going to sample data issue, I would like to know how you are
approaching the problem. If you have prepared a document outlining the
technical details, I would be happy to go through it.

If you wish, you can use some dummy values at the moment which we can
tweak later on.

With regard to program code requirement, you can write an small code that will allow conversion from one radiation unit(grey,sievert) to another. e.g.

Personal radiation dosage calculator
-------------------------------------
As stated, the aim of the application is to educate the Indian public and create awareness about the nuclear technology.
Please find below some links that will be useful during the application development.

Though the data is old (year - 2011), you have to design the application in such a way that such data can be imported on demand.
